# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description
This project is the first step towards building an AirBnB clone web application. The command interpreter developed in this project will manage AirBnB objects, allowing users to perform various operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a tool that allows users to interact with the AirBnB objects via a command-line interface. Below are instructions on how to start and use the command interpreter:

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the console.py script.


### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands to perform operations on AirBnB objects. Here are some examples of supported commands:

- `create <classname>`: Create a new instance of the specified class.
- `show <classname> <id>`: Show details of a specific instance.
- `update <classname> <id> <attribute> <value>`: Update the attributes of a specific instance.
- `destroy <classname> <id>`: Delete a specific instance.
- `all <classname>`: Show details of all instances of a specific class.
- `quit`: Exit the command interpreter.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the help command within the command interpreter.
